# Welcome To My [Portfolio](https://lukaa98.github.io/Portfolio/)
## This project showcases my Skills, Projects, and Experiences as a Software Engineer.

## Technologies Used:

### [React App:](https://react.dev/)
- This portfolio is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of reusable components, making the project more maintainable and efficient. [Create your own App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
  
### [GitHub Pages:](https://pages.github.com/)
- The portfolio is deployed on GitHub Pages, a free hosting service provided by GitHub. This enables easy access and sharing of my portfolio with others.
  
### [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) for Email Services:  
- To enable the contact functionality on the portfolio, I have integrated EmailJS. This allows visitors to send me messages directly from the portfolio, making it convenient and efficient to stay in touch.

### [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) (MUI) for Consistent Visuals:
- I have used Material-UI (MUI) to maintain a consistent and visually appealing design throughout the portfolio. Material-UI provides a set of pre-designed components and themes, making it easier to create a polished user interface.

### Open Source Skills Cloud Functionality:
- The skills cloud functionality on my portfolio is powered by an open-source script. This script allows the display of skills in a visually engaging manner, presenting them as a "skills cloud." The use of open-source software aligns with the principles of transparency and community-driven development. The script is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), and for more information, you can refer to [License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/)
